# TrainScheduler
https://dsc1996.github.io/TrainScheduler/
The Train Scheduler is a project I made to continue building my Firebase and moment.js skills. In this project, I used a Bootstrap interface, Javascript, jQuery and Firebase. 
When a user enters the information on the form, the train schedule populates with to the minute information on when that train will arrive and that information is stored in Firebase. To build this, I had to have a firm grasp of moment.js. While this was a challenge, I learned a lot from this project.
